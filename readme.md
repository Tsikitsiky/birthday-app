# Term 3 JS Project : Birthday App

This project is a CRUD app which shows people and their birthdays. 

The people in the list are from this API: [https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Pinois/e1c72b75917985dc77f5c808e876b67f/raw/93debb7463fbaaec29622221b8f9e719bd5b119f/birthdayPeople.json](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Pinois/e1c72b75917985dc77f5c808e876b67f/raw/93debb7463fbaaec29622221b8f9e719bd5b119f/birthdayPeople.json)

- On load, it fetches the above API and strores it in locale storage. 
- The list is intialised with the data from the locale storage.
- Users can add people to the list. They can edit and delete from the list.
- They can filter the list by their name, first name and last name and filter by birthday month

While I was doing this project, I learnt how to use date with javascript.
